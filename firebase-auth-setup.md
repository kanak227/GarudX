# Firebase Anonymous Authentication Setup

## Issue
You're getting the error: `Firebase: This operation is restricted to administrators only. (auth/admin-restricted-operation)`

This means **Anonymous Authentication** is disabled in your Firebase project.

## Solution: Enable Anonymous Authentication

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/medibot-b2bf7
2. Click on **Authentication** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Enable Anonymous Authentication
1. Click on the **Sign-in method** tab
2. Look for **Anonymous** in the list of sign-in providers
3. Click on **Anonymous**
4. Toggle the **Enable** switch to ON
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Verify Settings
After enabling anonymous authentication:
- The Anonymous provider should show as "Enabled"
- You should see a green checkmark next to it

## Alternative: Test Without Authentication

I've already updated your code to handle the case where anonymous auth is disabled:

### Updated Firestore Rules
Your Firestore rules now allow unauthenticated access for testing:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Chat messages - TESTING MODE: Allow all operations
    match /chat_messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Temporarily allow all access for testing
    }
    // ... other collections also allow unauthenticated access
  }
}
```

### Updated Chat Service
The chat service now gracefully handles authentication failures:
- If anonymous auth is disabled, it continues without authentication
- Operations will work because Firestore rules now allow unauthenticated access

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Enable Anonymous Auth (Recommended)
1. Enable anonymous authentication in Firebase Console (steps above)
2. Test the debug page: http://localhost:5173/debug-chat.html
3. You should see: ✅ Firebase Auth: Signed in anonymously

### Option 2: Test Without Authentication
1. Open debug page: http://localhost:5173/debug-chat.html
2. You should see: ⚠️ Anonymous auth disabled - continuing without authentication
3. Chat functionality should still work due to updated Firestore rules

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important for Production:**
- The current Firestore rules allow **anyone** to read/write chat messages
- This is only for development/testing purposes
- Before going to production:
  1. Enable proper authentication (anonymous or other methods)
  2. Restrict Firestore rules to authenticated users only
  3. Implement proper user validation

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Anonymous Auth** (recommended)
2. **Test the debug interface** to verify everything works
3. **Test the React app** chat functionality
4. **Test bidirectional communication** between doctor and patient interfaces

## Troubleshooting

If you still see authentication errors after enabling anonymous auth:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser developer console for any remaining errors
4. Verify Firebase project configuration in `src/config/firebase.ts`

The system should now work whether anonymous authentication is enabled or disabled!
